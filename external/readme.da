Upgrading openSceneGraph, osgBullet and osgWorks:

osg is now v3.3.2
update to osg required some small changes to omegaOsg, but otherwise went smoothly

osgWorks is now revision 565 (post v3.1) from svn (http://osgworks.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)
source for v3.0 did not work, after checking the revision logs, (specifically r554) found later versions
that were updated to work with changes to the osg 3.3.2 api

osgBullet is now revision 385 (post v3.0) from svn (http://osgbullet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)
v3.0 source did not work, used the latest revision instead after looking through revisions
